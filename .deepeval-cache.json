Introduction\\nThe success of Deep Learning hinges in part on the fact\\nthat models learned for one task can be used on other related\\ntasks. Yet, no general framework exists to describe and\\nlearn relations between tasks. We introduce the TASK 2VEC\\nembedding, a technique to represent tasks as elements of a\\nvector space based on the Fisher Information Matrix. The\\nnorm of the embedding correlates with the complexity of\\nthe task, while the distance between embeddings captures\\nsemantic similarities between tasks (Fig. 1). When other\\nnatural distances are available, such as the taxonomical dis-\\ntance in biological classi\\ufb01cation, we \\ufb01nd that the embed-\\nding distance correlates positively with it (Fig. 2). More-\\nover, we introduce an asymmetric distance on tasks which\\ncorrelates with the transferability between tasks.\\nComputation of the embedding leverages a duality be-\\ntween network parameters (weights) and outputs (activa-\\ntions) in a deep neural network (DNN): Just as the activa-\", \"network are useful to solve it (Sect. 2.1).\\nOur task embedding can be used to reason about the\\nspace of tasks and solve meta-tasks. As a motivating exam-\\nple, we study the problem of selecting the best pre-trained\\nfeature extractor to solve a new task. This can be particu-\\nlarly valuable when there is insuf\\ufb01cient data to train or \\ufb01ne-\\ntune a generic model, and transfer of knowledge is essen-\\ntial. TASK 2VEC depends solely on the task, and ignores\\ninteractions with the model which may however play an\\nimportant role. To address this, we learn a joint task and\\nmodel embedding, called MODEL 2VEC , in such a way that\\nmodels whose embeddings are close to a task exhibit good\\nperfmormance on the task.

Introduction\\nThe success of Deep Learning hinges in part on the fact\\nthat models learned for one task can be used on other related\\ntasks. Yet, no general framework exists to describe and\\nlearn relations between tasks.

The\\nnorm of the embedding correlates with the complexity of\\nthe task, while the distance between embeddings captures\\nsemantic similarities between tasks (Fig. 1). When other\\nnatural distances are available, such as the taxonomical dis-\\ntance in biological classi\\ufb01cation, we \\ufb01nd that the embed-\\nding distance correlates positively with it (Fig. 2). More-\\nover, we introduce an asymmetric distance on tasks which\\ncorrelates with the transferability between tasks.\\nComputation of the embedding leverages a duality be-\\ntween network parameters (weights) and outputs (activa-\\ntions) in a deep neural network (DNN): Just as the activa-\", \"network are useful to solve it (Sect. 2.1).\\nOur task embedding can be used to reason about the\\nspace of tasks and solve meta-tasks.
