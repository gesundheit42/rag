We train our models on trillions\\nof tokens, and show that it is possible to train\\nstate-of-the-art models using publicly avail-\\nable datasets exclusively, without resorting\\nto proprietary and inaccessible datasets. In\\nparticular, LLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3\\n(175B) on most benchmarks, and LLaMA-\\n65B is competitive with the best models,\\nChinchilla-70B and PaLM-540B. We release\\nall our models to the research community1.\\n1 Introduction\\nLarge Languages Models (LLMs) trained on mas-\\nsive corpora of texts have shown their ability to per-\\nform new tasks from textual instructions or from a\\n\\nLLaMA-13B outperforms GPT-3 on most bench-\\nmarks, despite being 10× smaller. We believe that\\nthis model will help democratize the access and\\nstudy of LLMs, since it can be run on a single GPU.\\nAt the higher-end of the scale, our 65B-parameter\\nmodel is also competitive with the best large lan-\\nguage models such as Chinchilla or PaLM-540B.\\nUnlike Chinchilla, PaLM, or GPT-3, we only\\nuse publicly available data, making our work com-\\npatible with open-sourcing, while most existing\\nmodels rely on data which is either not publicly\\navailable or undocumented (e.g. “Books – 2TB” or\\n“Social media conversations”). There exist some\\nexceptions, notably OPT (Zhang et al., 2022),\\nGPT-NeoX (Black et al., 2022), BLOOM (Scao\\net al., 2022) and GLM (Zeng et al., 2022), but none\\nthat are competitive with PaLM-62B or Chinchilla.\\nIn the rest of this paper, we present an overview\\nof the modiﬁcations we made to the transformer\\narchitecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), as well as our\\n\\nprocesses around 380 tokens/sec/GPU on 2048\\nA100 GPU with 80GB of RAM. This means that\\ntraining over our dataset containing 1.4T tokens\\ntakes approximately 21 days.\\n3 Main results\\nFollowing previous work (Brown et al., 2020), we\\nconsider zero-shot and few-shot tasks, and report\\nresults on a total of 20 benchmarks:\\n• Zero-shot. We provide a textual description\\nof the task and a test example. The model\\neither provides an answer using open-ended\\ngeneration, or ranks the proposed answers.\\n• Few-shot.

Computer vision research has also demon-\\nstrated the importance of transfer learning from\\nlarge pre-trained models, where an effective recipe\\nis to ﬁne-tune models pre-trained with Ima-\\ngeNet (Deng et al., 2009; Yosinski et al., 2014).\\n3 BERT\\nWe introduce BERT and its detailed implementa-\\ntion in this section. There are two steps in our\\nframework: pre-training and ﬁne-tuning. Dur-\\ning pre-training, the model is trained on unlabeled\\ndata over different pre-training tasks. For ﬁne-\\ntuning, the BERT model is ﬁrst initialized with\\nthe pre-trained parameters, and all of the param-\\n\\nBERT -style pretraining crucially relies on large\\nquantities of text.\\nBaevski et al. (2019) demon-\\nstrate that increasing data size can result in im-\\nproved end-task performance. Several efforts\\nhave trained on datasets larger and more diverse\\nthan the original BERT (\\nRadford et al. , 2019;\\nY ang et al. , 2019; Zellers et al. , 2019). Unfortu-\\nnately , not all of the additional datasets can be\\npublicly released. For our study , we focus on gath-\\nering as much data as possible for experimenta-\\ntion, allowing us to match the overall quality and\\nquantity of data as appropriate for each compari-\\nson.\\nW e consider ﬁve English-language corpora of\\nvarying sizes and domains, totaling over 160GB\\nof uncompressed text.

We ﬁnd that while most recent\\nmodels have near random-chance accuracy, the very largest GPT-3 model improves\\nover random chance by almost 20 percentage points on average. However, on every\\none of the 57 tasks, the best models still need substantial improvements before\\nthey can reach expert-level accuracy.

Aside from the tremendous expense in creating multi-trillion\\nparameter language models, data may also become a bottleneck, as there is far less written about\\nesoteric branches of knowledge than about everyday situations.\\n6 C ONCLUSION\\nWe introduced a new test that measures how well text models can learn and apply knowledge\\nencountered during pretraining. By covering 57 subjects at varying levels of difﬁculty, the test\\nassesses language understanding in greater breadth and depth than previous benchmarks. We found\\nthat it has recently become possible for models to make meaningful progress on the test, but that\\nstate-of-the-art models have lopsided performance and rarely excel at any individual task.

The models share the same for-\\nmat: given a context and an ending, return a logit\\nfor that ending. Accordingly, we train our models\\nusing a four-way cross-entropy loss, where the ob-\\njective is to predict the correct ending. In addition\\nto BERT-Large, our comparisons include:\\na.

Surprisingly, despite BERT-\\nLarge having been used as the adversarial ﬁlter,\\nit still performs the strongest at 47.3% overall.\\nBy making the dataset adversarial for BERT, it\\nseems to also have become adversarial for every\\nother model. For instance, while ESIM +ELMo\\nobtained 59% accuracy on SW AG, it obtains only\\n33.3% accuracy on HellaSwag.\\nIn addition to pretraining being critical, so too is\\nend-to-end ﬁnetuning.

More-\\nover, we introduce an asymmetric distance on tasks which\\ncorrelates with the transferability between tasks.\\nComputation of the embedding leverages a duality be-\\ntween network parameters (weights) and outputs (activa-\\ntions) in a deep neural network (DNN): Just as the activa-\\n\\nthe few experts for the task, which we propose.\\nDependence on task dataset size Finding experts is es-\\npecially important when the task we are interested in has\\nrelatively few samples. In Fig. 4 we show how the perfor-\\nmance of TASK 2VEC varies on a model selection task as the\\nnumber of samples varies. At all sample sizesTASK 2VEC is\\nclose to the optimum, and improves over selecting a generic\\nexpert (ImageNet), both when ﬁne-tuning and when train-\\ning only a classiﬁer. We observe that the best choice of ex-\\nperts is not affected by the dataset size, and that even with\\nfew examples TASK 2VEC is able to ﬁnd the optimal experts.\\nChoice of probe network In Table 1 we show that\\nDenseNet [15] and ResNet architectures [11] perform sig-\\nniﬁcantly better when used as probe networks to compute\\nthe TASK 2VEC embedding than a VGG [32] architecture.\\n6.

As it has been widely realized that it is computationally unaffordable to\\nempirically enumerate all possible designs for training 100B-scale LLMs, we present not only the\\nsuccessful part for training GLM-130B but also many of the failed options and lessons learned.\\nParticularly, the training stability is the decisive factor in the success of training models of such a\\nscale. Different from practices such as manually adjusting learning rates in OPT-175B and using\\nembedding norm in the sacrifice of performance in BLOOM-176B, we experiment with various op-\\ntions and find the strategy of embedding gradient shrink can significantly stabilize the training of\\nGLM-130B.\\n\\nPublished as a conference paper at ICLR 2023\\nGradient Norm\\n(a) More than 30 failed preliminary trials at 100B-scale (b) Final decisive trials: Sandwich-LN v.s.

It turns out that DeepNorm is the\\nmost stable one, as it has small gradient norm and does not spike in the early stage training.\\nWe open-source the model checkpoints, code, training logs, related toolkits, and lessons learned.\\n2 T HE DESIGN CHOICES OF GLM-130B\\nThe architecture of a machine learning model defines its inductive bias. However, it has been real-\\nized that it is computationally unaffordable to explore various architectural designs for LLMs. We\\nintroduce and explain the unique design choices of GLM-130B.\\n2.1 GLM-130B’ S ARCHITECTURE\\nGLM as Backbone.

We use a dropout rate of 0.1\\nand clip gradients using a clipping value of 1.0 (Cf. Table 11 for the full configurations).\\n3 T HE TRAINING STABILITY OF GLM-130B\\nThe training stability is the decisive factor in GLM-130B’s quality, which is also largely impacted\\nby the number of tokens it passes through (Hoffmann et al., 2022). Thus, given the computing\\nusage constraint, there has to be a trade-off between efficiency and stability with regard to floating-\\npoint (FP) formats: low-precision FP formats (e.g., 16-bit precision—FP16) improve computing\\nefficiency but are prone to overflow and underflow errors, resulting in training collapses.\\n(a) Gradient norm with EGS α = 0.1\\n(b) EGS in 40B-scale testing\\nFigure 4: EGS reduces gradi-\\nent scale and variance to stabi-\\nlize LLMs’ pre-training.\\nMixed-Precision.

This aligns with our commitment to “LLM\\nInclusivity”, as it is necessary to include more people in the open-sourced LLM research to facilitate\\n\\ninclusive LLM research. GLM-130B’s technical and engineering undertakings generate insight into\\nLLMs’ architectures, pre-training objectives, training stability and efficiency, and affordable infer-\\nence. Altogether, it contributes to the high quality of GLM-130B in terms of both language perfor-\\nmance on 112 tasks and ethical results on bias and toxicity benchmarks.

The unifying theme of these methods is that they couple self-supervised learning\\nfrom massive unlabelled text corpora with effective adapting of the resulting model to target tasks.\\nThe tasks that have proven amenable to this general approach include question answering, textual\\nentailment, and parsing, among many others (Devlin et al., 2019; Kitaev et al., 2019, i.a.).\\nIn this context, the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019a) has become a prominent evaluation\\nframework for research towards general-purpose language understanding technologies. GLUE is\\n\\nremains substantial scope for improvement towards GLUE’s high-level goals, the original version of\\nthe benchmark is no longer a suitable metric for quantifying such progress.\\nIn response, we introduce SuperGLUE, a new benchmark designed to pose a more rigorous test of\\nlanguage understanding. SuperGLUE has the same high-level motivation as GLUE: to provide a\\nsimple, hard-to-game measure of progress toward general-purpose language understanding technolo-\\ngies for English. We anticipate that signiﬁcant progress on SuperGLUE should require substantive\\ninnovations in a number of core areas of machine learning, including sample-efﬁcient, transfer,\\nmultitask, and unsupervised or self-supervised learning.\\nSuperGLUE follows the basic design of GLUE: It consists of a public leaderboard built around\\neight language understanding tasks, drawing on existing data, accompanied by a single-number\\nperformance metric, and an analysis toolkit. However, it improves upon GLUE in several ways:\\n\\ntasks having fewer than 1k examples and all but one of the tasks having fewer than 10k examples.\\nWe evaluate BERT-based baselines and ﬁnd that they still lag behind humans by nearly 20 points.\\nGiven the difﬁculty of SuperGLUE for BERT, we expect that further progress in multi-task, transfer,\\nand unsupervised/self-supervised learning techniques will be necessary to approach human-level per-\\nformance on the benchmark. Overall, we argue that SuperGLUE offers a rich and challenging testbed\\nfor work developing new general-purpose machine learning methods for language understanding.\\n7 Acknowledgments\\nWe thank the original authors of the included datasets in SuperGLUE for their cooperation in the\\ncreation of the benchmark, as well as those who proposed tasks and datasets that we ultimately\\ncould not include.

The unifying theme of these methods is that they couple self-supervised learning\\nfrom massive unlabelled text corpora with effective adapting of the resulting model to target tasks.\\nThe tasks that have proven amenable to this general approach include question answering, textual\\nentailment, and parsing, among many others (Devlin et al., 2019; Kitaev et al., 2019, i.a.).\\nIn this context, the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019a) has become a prominent evaluation\\nframework for research towards general-purpose language understanding technologies. GLUE is\\n\\nremains substantial scope for improvement towards GLUE’s high-level goals, the original version of\\nthe benchmark is no longer a suitable metric for quantifying such progress.\\nIn response, we introduce SuperGLUE, a new benchmark designed to pose a more rigorous test of\\nlanguage understanding. SuperGLUE has the same high-level motivation as GLUE: to provide a\\nsimple, hard-to-game measure of progress toward general-purpose language understanding technolo-\\ngies for English. We anticipate that signiﬁcant progress on SuperGLUE should require substantive\\ninnovations in a number of core areas of machine learning, including sample-efﬁcient, transfer,\\nmultitask, and unsupervised or self-supervised learning.\\nSuperGLUE follows the basic design of GLUE: It consists of a public leaderboard built around\\neight language understanding tasks, drawing on existing data, accompanied by a single-number\\nperformance metric, and an analysis toolkit. However, it improves upon GLUE in several ways:\\n\\ntasks having fewer than 1k examples and all but one of the tasks having fewer than 10k examples.\\nWe evaluate BERT-based baselines and ﬁnd that they still lag behind humans by nearly 20 points.\\nGiven the difﬁculty of SuperGLUE for BERT, we expect that further progress in multi-task, transfer,\\nand unsupervised/self-supervised learning techniques will be necessary to approach human-level per-\\nformance on the benchmark. Overall, we argue that SuperGLUE offers a rich and challenging testbed\\nfor work developing new general-purpose machine learning methods for language understanding.\\n7 Acknowledgments\\nWe thank the original authors of the included datasets in SuperGLUE for their cooperation in the\\ncreation of the benchmark, as well as those who proposed tasks and datasets that we ultimately\\ncould not include.

Large\\n\\nIn summary, our contributions are as follows:\\n• We implement a simple and efﬁcient model parallel\\napproach by making only a few targeted modiﬁcations\\nto an existing PyTorch transformer implementation.\\n• We perform an in-depth empirical analysis of our\\nmodel and data parallel technique and demonstrate\\nup to 76% scaling efﬁciency using 512 GPUs.\\n• We show that careful attention to the placement of\\nlayer normalization in BERT-like models is critical to\\nachieving increased accuracies as the model grows.\\n• We demonstrate that scaling the model size results in\\nimproved accuracies for both GPT-2 (studied up to\\n8.3 billion parameters) and BERT (studied up to 3.9B\\nparameters) models.\\n• We showcase that our models achieve state of the art\\nresults on test sets: perplexity on WikiText103 (10.8\\nppl), accuracy on LAMBADA (66.5%), and accuracy\\non RACE (90.9%).\\n• We open source our code along with the training\\nand evaluation pipelines athttps://github.com/\\nNVIDIA/Megatron-LM \\nAnswer:\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})]\n",

Segments usually consist of\\nmore than one natural sentence. The two seg-\\nments are presented as a single input sequence\\nto BERT with special tokens delimiting them:', '7 Conclusion\\nW e carefully evaluate a number of design de-\\ncisions when pretraining BERT models. W e\\nﬁnd that performance can be substantially im-\\nproved by training the model longer, with bigger\\nbatches over more data; removing the next sen-\\ntence prediction objective; training on longer se-\\nquences; and dynamically changing the masking\\npattern applied to the training data. Our improved\\npretraining procedure, which we call RoBERT a,\\nachieves state-of-the-art results on GLUE, RACE\\nand SQuAD, without multi-task ﬁnetuning for\\nGLUE or additional data for SQuAD. These re-\\nsults illustrate the importance of these previ-\\nously overlooked design decisions and suggest\\nthat BERT’s pretraining objective remains com-\\npetitive with recently proposed alternatives.\\nW e additionally use a novel dataset,\\nCC-N EW S , and release our models and\\ncode for pretraining and ﬁnetuning at:\\nhttps://github.com/pytorch/fairseq.\\nReferences\\nEneko Agirre, Llu’is M‘arquez, and Richard Wicen-']\n",

Does\\nthis mean that machines can perform human\\nlevel commonsense inference?\\nIn this paper, we show that commonsense in-\\nference still proves di ﬃcult for even state-\\nof-the-art models, by presenting HellaSwag,\\na new challenge dataset. Though its ques-\\ntions are trivial for humans (ą95% accuracy),\\nstate-of-the-art models struggle ( ă48%). We', 'BERT, perform at commonsense natural language\\ninference (NLI)? Our surprising conclusion is\\nthat the underlying task remains unsolved. In-\\ndeed, we ﬁnd that deep models such as BERT do\\nnot demonstrate robust commonsense reasonining\\nability by themselves. Instead, they operate more\\nlike rapid surface learners for a particular dataset.\\nTheir strong performance on SW AG is dependent\\non the ﬁnetuning process, wherein they largely\\nlearn to pick up on dataset-speciﬁc distributional\\nbiases. When the distribution of language shifts\\nslightly, performance drops drastically – even if\\nthe domain remains identical.\\nWe study this question by introducing Hella-\\nSwag,2 a new benchmark for commonsense\\nNLI. We use Adversarial Filtering (AF), a data-\\ncollection paradigm in which a series of discrim-\\ninators is used to select a challenging set of gen-\\nerated wrong answers.

Introduction\\nThe success of Deep Learning hinges in part on the fact\\nthat models learned for one task can be used on other related\\ntasks. Yet, no general framework exists to describe and\\nlearn relations between tasks. We introduce the TASK 2VEC\\nembedding, a technique to represent tasks as elements of a\\nvector space based on the Fisher Information Matrix. The\\nnorm of the embedding correlates with the complexity of\\nthe task, while the distance between embeddings captures\\nsemantic similarities between tasks (Fig. 1). When other\\nnatural distances are available, such as the taxonomical dis-\\ntance in biological classiﬁcation, we ﬁnd that the embed-\\nding distance correlates positively with it (Fig. 2). More-\\nover, we introduce an asymmetric distance on tasks which\\ncorrelates with the transferability between tasks.\\nComputation of the embedding leverages a duality be-\\ntween network parameters (weights) and outputs (activa-\\ntions) in a deep neural network (DNN): Just as the activa-', 'the few experts for the task, which we propose.\\nDependence on task dataset size Finding experts is es-\\npecially important when the task we are interested in has\\nrelatively few samples.

The unifying theme of these methods is that they couple self-supervised learning\\nfrom massive unlabelled text corpora with effective adapting of the resulting model to target tasks.\\nThe tasks that have proven amenable to this general approach include question answering, textual\\nentailment, and parsing, among many others (Devlin et al., 2019; Kitaev et al., 2019, i.a.).\\nIn this context, the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019a) has become a prominent evaluation\\nframework for research towards general-purpose language understanding technologies. GLUE is', 'remains substantial scope for improvement towards GLUE’s high-level goals, the original version of\\nthe benchmark is no longer a suitable metric for quantifying such progress.\\nIn response, we introduce SuperGLUE, a new benchmark designed to pose a more rigorous test of\\nlanguage understanding. SuperGLUE has the same high-level motivation as GLUE: to provide a\\nsimple, hard-to-game measure of progress toward general-purpose language understanding technolo-\\ngies for English. We anticipate that signiﬁcant progress on SuperGLUE should require substantive\\ninnovations in a number of core areas of machine learning, including sample-efﬁcient, transfer,\\nmultitask, and unsupervised or self-supervised learning.\\nSuperGLUE follows the basic design of GLUE: It consists of a public leaderboard built around\\neight language understanding tasks, drawing on existing data, accompanied by a single-number\\nperformance metric, and an analysis toolkit. However, it improves upon GLUE in several ways:', 'tasks having fewer than 1k examples and all but one of the tasks having fewer than 10k examples.\\nWe evaluate BERT-based baselines and ﬁnd that they still lag behind humans by nearly 20 points.\\nGiven the difﬁculty of SuperGLUE for BERT, we expect that further progress in multi-task, transfer,\\nand unsupervised/self-supervised learning techniques will be necessary to approach human-level per-\\nformance on the benchmark. Overall, we argue that SuperGLUE offers a rich and challenging testbed\\nfor work developing new general-purpose machine learning methods for language understanding.\\n7 Acknowledgments\\nWe thank the original authors of the included datasets in SuperGLUE for their cooperation in the\\ncreation of the benchmark, as well as those who proposed tasks and datasets that we ultimately\\ncould not include.

The unifying theme of these methods is that they couple self-supervised learning\\nfrom massive unlabelled text corpora with effective adapting of the resulting model to target tasks.\\nThe tasks that have proven amenable to this general approach include question answering, textual\\nentailment, and parsing, among many others (Devlin et al., 2019; Kitaev et al., 2019, i.a.).\\nIn this context, the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019a) has become a prominent evaluation\\nframework for research towards general-purpose language understanding technologies.

Though GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) is the pioneer for this effort, it is not\\navailable to most people in the world. In addition, it supports English only. We therefore decide to\\ninitialize the project GLM-130B. Please note that the WuDao 1.75T model we built last year is a\\nsparse model with 480 mixture-of-experts (MoE), rather than a dense one as GPT-3. Our goal then\\nis to train a bilingual pre-trained dense model with high accuracy on downstream tasks, and to make\\nit open to everyone in the world-anyone, anywhere can download it and use it on a single server with\\nappropriate GPUs.\\nThe ambitious project soon faced several important challenges:', 'Inference. Most public-accessible LLMs nowadays are providing their services via limited APIs.In\\nthis work, an important part of our endeavor has been on LLMs’ efficient and fast inference.

Very recent work (Dettmers et al., 2022) shows that LLMs such as OPT-175B and\\nBLOOM-176B can be quantized to 8 bit due to special distribution of outlier dimensions. In this\\nwork, we demonstrate GLM’s scaling law for INT4 weight quantization, which allows GLM-130B\\nto inference on as few as 4×RTX 3090 (24G) GPUs or 8×RTX 2080 Ti (11G) GPUs.\\n7 C ONCLUSION AND LESSONS\\nWe introduce GLM-130B, a bilingual pre-trained language model that aims to facilitate open and\\ninclusive LLM research.

      "  - ✅ Correctness (GEval) (score: 0.7, threshold: 0.5, strict: False, evaluation model: Ollama AI Model, reason: The actual output correctly identifies SuperGLUE as a more challenging benchmark than GLUE, aligning with the expected output's mention of more difficult tasks. However, it lacks specific details about task diversification and human baseline performances that are present in the expected output. The paraphrasing maintains the original intent but omits key aspects like coreference resolution and question answering formats. No irrelevant information is included., error: None)\n",
      "  - ✅ Contextual Precision (score: 1.0, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: Ollama AI Model, reason: The score is 1.00 because all relevant nodes are ranked higher than irrelevant ones. The first node provides direct information about SuperGLUE's design changes, making it highly relevant. The second node supports this by highlighting the benchmark's challenge through human baseline performances. The third node, while discussing SuperGLUE's motivation and design, is deemed less relevant as it does not specifically address how it ensures a more challenging benchmark compared to GLUE., error: None)\n",
      "  - ❌ Contextual Relevancy (score: 0.2857142857142857, threshold: 0.7, strict: False, evaluation model: Ollama AI Model, reason: The score is 0.29 because the retrieval context includes relevant statements such as 'SuperGLUE is designed to pose a more rigorous test of language understanding than GLUE' and 'SuperGLUE, a new benchmark styled after GLUE with a new set of more difficult language understanding tasks,' which directly address how SuperGLUE's design ensures it presents a more challenging benchmark.

In\\ncontrast, GLUE provides a lightweight classiﬁcation API and no restrictions on model architecture or\\nparameter sharing, which seems to have been well-suited to recent work in this area.\\nSince its release, GLUE has been used as a testbed and showcase by the developers of several\\ninﬂuential models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2018) and BERT (Devlin et al., 2019). As shown\\nin Figure 1, progress on GLUE since its release has been striking.

W e\\nﬁnd that performance can be substantially im-\\nproved by training the model longer, with bigger\\nbatches over more data; removing the next sen-\\ntence prediction objective; training on longer se-\\nquences; and dynamically changing the masking\\npattern applied to the training data.

The ﬁrst sentence receives the A\\nembedding and the second receives the B embed-\\nding. 50% of the time B is the actual next sentence\\nthat follows A and 50% of the time it is a random\\nsentence, which is done for the “next sentence pre-\\ndiction” task. They are sampled such that the com-', '[MASK ]. The MLM objective is a cross-entropy\\nloss on predicting the masked tokens. BERT uni-\\nformly selects 15% of the input tokens for possi-\\nble replacement. Of the selected tokens, 80% are\\nreplaced with[MASK ], 10% are left unchanged,\\nand 10% are replaced by a randomly selected vo-\\ncabulary token.\\nIn the original implementation, random mask-\\ning and replacement is performed once in the be-\\nginning and saved for the duration of training, al-\\nthough in practice, data is duplicated so the mask\\nis not always the same for every training sentence\\n(see Section\\n4.1).\\nNext Sentence Prediction (NSP) NSP is a bi-\\nnary classiﬁcation loss for predicting whether two\\nsegments follow each other in the original text.\\nPositive examples are created by taking consecu-\\ntive sentences from the text corpus. Negative ex-\\namples are created by pairing segments from dif-\\nferent documents. Positive and negative examples\\nare sampled with equal probability .\\nThe NSP objective was designed to improve', 'the i-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of\\nthe time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3)\\nthe unchanged i-th token 10% of the time.

(2018) intro-\\nduced a new task ofcommonsense natural lan-\\nguage inference : given an event description\\nsuch as “A woman sits at a piano,” a machine\\nmust select the most likely followup: “She\\nsets her ﬁngers on the keys.” With the intro-\\nduction of BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), near\\nhuman-level performance was reached. Does\\nthis mean that machines can perform human\\nlevel commonsense inference?\\nIn this paper, we show that commonsense in-\\nference still proves di ﬃcult for even state-\\nof-the-art models, by presenting HellaSwag,\\na new challenge dataset. Though its ques-\\ntions are trivial for humans (ą95% accuracy),\\nstate-of-the-art models struggle ( ă48%). We', 'BERT, perform at commonsense natural language\\ninference (NLI)? Our surprising conclusion is\\nthat the underlying task remains unsolved. In-\\ndeed, we ﬁnd that deep models such as BERT do\\nnot demonstrate robust commonsense reasonining\\nability by themselves. Instead, they operate more\\nlike rapid surface learners for a particular dataset.\\nTheir strong performance on SW AG is dependent\\non the ﬁnetuning process, wherein they largely\\nlearn to pick up on dataset-speciﬁc distributional\\nbiases. When the distribution of language shifts\\nslightly, performance drops drastically – even if\\nthe domain remains identical.\\nWe study this question by introducing Hella-\\nSwag,2 a new benchmark for commonsense\\nNLI. We use Adversarial Filtering (AF), a data-\\ncollection paradigm in which a series of discrim-\\ninators is used to select a challenging set of gen-\\nerated wrong answers.

Training is computationally expen-\\nsive, often done on private datasets of different\\nsizes, and, as we will show , hyperparameter\\nchoices have signiﬁcant impact on the ﬁnal re-\\nsults. W e present a replication study of BER T\\npretraining (\\nDevlin et al. , 2019) that carefully\\nmeasures the impact of many key hyperparam-\\neters and training data size. W e ﬁnd that BER T', 'cally , RoBERT a is trained with dynamic mask-\\ning (Section\\n4.1), FU LL -SEN TE N C E S without NSP\\nloss (Section 4.2), large mini-batches (Section 4.3)\\nand a larger byte-level BPE (Section 4.4).\\nAdditionally , we investigate two other impor-\\ntant factors that have been under-emphasized in\\nprevious work: (1) the data used for pretraining,\\nand (2) the number of training passes through the\\ndata. For example, the recently proposed XLNet\\narchitecture (\\nY ang et al. , 2019) is pretrained us-\\ning nearly 10 times more data than the original\\nBERT (\\nDevlin et al. , 2019). It is also trained with\\na batch size eight times larger for half as many op-\\ntimization steps, thus seeing four times as many\\nsequences in pretraining compared to BERT .\\nT o help disentangle the importance of these fac-\\ntors from other modeling choices (e.g., the pre-\\ntraining objective), we begin by training RoBERT a\\nfollowing the BERTL A R G E architecture ( L = 24,\\nH = 1024, A = 16, 355M parameters). W e', '7 Conclusion\\nW e carefully evaluate a number of design de-\\ncisions when pretraining BERT models. W e\\nﬁnd that performance can be substantially im-\\nproved by training the model longer, with bigger\\nbatches over more data; removing the next sen-\\ntence prediction objective; training on longer se-\\nquences; and dynamically changing the masking\\npattern applied to the training data. Our improved\\npretraining procedure, which we call RoBERT a,\\nachieves state-of-the-art results on GLUE, RACE\\nand SQuAD, without multi-task ﬁnetuning for\\nGLUE or additional data for SQuAD.

Training is computationally expen-\\nsive, often done on private datasets of different\\nsizes, and, as we will show , hyperparameter\\nchoices have signiﬁcant impact on the ﬁnal re-\\nsults. W e present a replication study of BER T\\npretraining (\\nDevlin et al. , 2019) that carefully\\nmeasures the impact of many key hyperparam-\\neters and training data size. W e ﬁnd that BER T', 'cally , RoBERT a is trained with dynamic mask-\\ning (Section\\n4.1), FU LL -SEN TE N C E S without NSP\\nloss (Section 4.2), large mini-batches (Section 4.3)\\nand a larger byte-level BPE (Section 4.4).\\nAdditionally , we investigate two other impor-\\ntant factors that have been under-emphasized in\\nprevious work: (1) the data used for pretraining,\\nand (2) the number of training passes through the\\ndata. For example, the recently proposed XLNet\\narchitecture (\\nY ang et al. , 2019) is pretrained us-\\ning nearly 10 times more data than the original\\nBERT (\\nDevlin et al. , 2019). It is also trained with\\na batch size eight times larger for half as many op-\\ntimization steps, thus seeing four times as many\\nsequences in pretraining compared to BERT .\\nT o help disentangle the importance of these fac-\\ntors from other modeling choices (e.g., the pre-\\ntraining objective), we begin by training RoBERT a\\nfollowing the BERTL A R G E architecture ( L = 24,\\nH = 1024, A = 16, 355M parameters). W e', '7 Conclusion\\nW e carefully evaluate a number of design de-\\ncisions when pretraining BERT models. W e\\nﬁnd that performance can be substantially im-\\nproved by training the model longer, with bigger\\nbatches over more data; removing the next sen-\\ntence prediction objective; training on longer se-\\nquences; and dynamically changing the masking\\npattern applied to the training data.

Introduction\\nThe success of Deep Learning hinges in part on the fact\\nthat models learned for one task can be used on other related\\ntasks. Yet, no general framework exists to describe and\\nlearn relations between tasks. We introduce the TASK 2VEC\\nembedding, a technique to represent tasks as elements of a\\nvector space based on the Fisher Information Matrix. The\\nnorm of the embedding correlates with the complexity of\\nthe task, while the distance between embeddings captures\\nsemantic similarities between tasks (Fig. 1). When other\\nnatural distances are available, such as the taxonomical dis-\\ntance in biological classiﬁcation, we ﬁnd that the embed-\\nding distance correlates positively with it (Fig. 2). More-\\nover, we introduce an asymmetric distance on tasks which\\ncorrelates with the transferability between tasks.\\nComputation of the embedding leverages a duality be-\\ntween network parameters (weights) and outputs (activa-\\ntions) in a deep neural network (DNN): Just as the activa-', 'the few experts for the task, which we propose.\\nDependence on task dataset size Finding experts is es-\\npecially important when the task we are interested in has\\nrelatively few samples.

At all sample sizesTASK 2VEC is\\nclose to the optimum, and improves over selecting a generic\\nexpert (ImageNet), both when ﬁne-tuning and when train-\\ning only a classiﬁer. We observe that the best choice of ex-\\nperts is not affected by the dataset size, and that even with\\nfew examples TASK 2VEC is able to ﬁnd the optimal experts.\\nChoice of probe network In Table 1 we show that\\nDenseNet [15] and ResNet architectures [11] perform sig-\\nniﬁcantly better when used as probe networks to compute\\nthe TASK 2VEC embedding than a VGG [32] architecture.\\n6.

Introduction\\nThe success of Deep Learning hinges in part on the fact\\nthat models learned for one task can be used on other related\\ntasks. Yet, no general framework exists to describe and\\nlearn relations between tasks. We introduce the TASK 2VEC\\nembedding, a technique to represent tasks as elements of a\\nvector space based on the Fisher Information Matrix. The\\nnorm of the embedding correlates with the complexity of\\nthe task, while the distance between embeddings captures\\nsemantic similarities between tasks (Fig. 1). When other\\nnatural distances are available, such as the taxonomical dis-\\ntance in biological classiﬁcation, we ﬁnd that the embed-\\nding distance correlates positively with it (Fig. 2). More-\\nover, we introduce an asymmetric distance on tasks which\\ncorrelates with the transferability between tasks.\\nComputation of the embedding leverages a duality be-\\ntween network parameters (weights) and outputs (activa-\\ntions) in a deep neural network (DNN): Just as the activa-', 'network are useful to solve it (Sect. 2.1).\\nOur task embedding can be used to reason about the\\nspace of tasks and solve meta-tasks. As a motivating exam-\\nple, we study the problem of selecting the best pre-trained\\nfeature extractor to solve a new task.

Much of this success can be\\nattributed to prompting methods such as “chain-\\nof-thought”, which employ LLMs for both under-\\nstanding the problem description by decomposing\\nit into steps, as well as solving each step of the\\nproblem. While LLMs seem to be adept at this\\nsort of step-by-step decomposition, LLMs often\\nmake logical and arithmetic mistakes in the solu-\\ntion part, even when the problem is decomposed\\ncorrectly. In this paper, we present Program-\\nAided Language models (PAL): a novel approach\\nthat uses the LLM to read natural language prob-', 'and “incorrect calculation” (Lewkowycz et al., 2022).\\nIn this paper, we propose Program-Aided Language\\nmodel (PAL): a novel method that uses an LLM to read\\nnatural language problems and generate programs as rea-\\nsoning steps, but ofﬂoads the solution step to a Python inter-\\npreter, as illustrated in Figure 1. This ofﬂoading leverages an\\nLLM that can decompose a natural language problem into\\nprogrammatic steps, which is fortunately available using\\ncontemporary state-of-the-art LLMs that are pre-trained on\\nboth natural language and programming languages (Brown\\net al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021a; Chowdhery et al., 2022).\\nWhile natural language understanding and decomposition\\narXiv:2211.10435v2  [cs.CL]  27 Jan 2023']), TestResult(name='test_case_68', success=False, metrics_data=[MetricData(name='Correctness (GEval)', threshold=0.5, success=True, score=0.8, reason=\"Both outputs accurately identify PAL's use of Python for handling large numbers and contrast it with chain-of-thought models' limitations.

When other\\nnatural distances are available, such as the taxonomical dis-\\ntance in biological classiﬁcation, we ﬁnd that the embed-\\nding distance correlates positively with it (Fig. 2).

However, it has been real-\\nized that it is computationally unaffordable to explore various architectural designs for LLMs. We\\nintroduce and explain the unique design choices of GLM-130B.\\n2.1 GLM-130B’ S ARCHITECTURE\\nGLM as Backbone.

We use a dropout rate of 0.1\\nand clip gradients using a clipping value of 1.0 (Cf. Table 11 for the full configurations).\\n3 T HE TRAINING STABILITY OF GLM-130B\\nThe training stability is the decisive factor in GLM-130B’s quality, which is also largely impacted\\nby the number of tokens it passes through (Hoffmann et al., 2022). Thus, given the computing\\nusage constraint, there has to be a trade-off between efficiency and stability with regard to floating-\\npoint (FP) formats: low-precision FP formats (e.g., 16-bit precision—FP16) improve computing\\nefficiency but are prone to overflow and underflow errors, resulting in training collapses.\\n(a) Gradient norm with EGS α = 0.1\\n(b) EGS in 40B-scale testing\\nFigure 4: EGS reduces gradi-\\nent scale and variance to stabi-\\nlize LLMs’ pre-training.\\nMixed-Precision.

It\\nalso contains documented tools to transform code samples into intermediate representations and to', 'Code graphs. We augment the tool chain with a code graph generator using W ALA [28], a general\\nframework for program analysis. The backbone of a code graph is a system dependence graph, which\\nis an inter-procedural graph of program instructions (e.g. call, read) expressing control ﬂow and\\ndata ﬂow information as edges. We also generate inter-procedural control ﬂow graphs, which are\\ncontrol ﬂow graphs of all the methods in the program, stitched together to connect call sites with\\ntarget methods. Our code graph tool currently supports only Java and Python, but we plan to support\\nmore languages such as Javascript.\\n7 CodeNet Challenge\\nThe launch of CodeNet was well received by the AI community and the media, with coverage\\nfrom Forbes[29], VentureBeat[30], ZDNet[31] and others.

The unifying theme of these methods is that they couple self-supervised learning\\nfrom massive unlabelled text corpora with effective adapting of the resulting model to target tasks.\\nThe tasks that have proven amenable to this general approach include question answering, textual\\nentailment, and parsing, among many others (Devlin et al., 2019; Kitaev et al., 2019, i.a.).\\nIn this context, the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019a) has become a prominent evaluation\\nframework for research towards general-purpose language understanding technologies. GLUE is', 'tasks having fewer than 1k examples and all but one of the tasks having fewer than 10k examples.\\nWe evaluate BERT-based baselines and ﬁnd that they still lag behind humans by nearly 20 points.\\nGiven the difﬁculty of SuperGLUE for BERT, we expect that further progress in multi-task, transfer,\\nand unsupervised/self-supervised learning techniques will be necessary to approach human-level per-\\nformance on the benchmark. Overall, we argue that SuperGLUE offers a rich and challenging testbed\\nfor work developing new general-purpose machine learning methods for language understanding.\\n7 Acknowledgments\\nWe thank the original authors of the included datasets in SuperGLUE for their cooperation in the\\ncreation of the benchmark, as well as those who proposed tasks and datasets that we ultimately\\ncould not include.

We gratefully acknowledge', 'remains substantial scope for improvement towards GLUE’s high-level goals, the original version of\\nthe benchmark is no longer a suitable metric for quantifying such progress.\\nIn response, we introduce SuperGLUE, a new benchmark designed to pose a more rigorous test of\\nlanguage understanding. SuperGLUE has the same high-level motivation as GLUE: to provide a\\nsimple, hard-to-game measure of progress toward general-purpose language understanding technolo-\\ngies for English. We anticipate that signiﬁcant progress on SuperGLUE should require substantive\\ninnovations in a number of core areas of machine learning, including sample-efﬁcient, transfer,\\nmultitask, and unsupervised or self-supervised learning.\\nSuperGLUE follows the basic design of GLUE: It consists of a public leaderboard built around\\neight language understanding tasks, drawing on existing data, accompanied by a single-number\\nperformance metric, and an analysis toolkit.

The unifying theme of these methods is that they couple self-supervised learning\\nfrom massive unlabelled text corpora with effective adapting of the resulting model to target tasks.\\nThe tasks that have proven amenable to this general approach include question answering, textual\\nentailment, and parsing, among many others (Devlin et al., 2019; Kitaev et al., 2019, i.a.).\\nIn this context, the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019a) has become a prominent evaluation\\nframework for research towards general-purpose language understanding technologies. GLUE is', 'tasks having fewer than 1k examples and all but one of the tasks having fewer than 10k examples.\\nWe evaluate BERT-based baselines and ﬁnd that they still lag behind humans by nearly 20 points.\\nGiven the difﬁculty of SuperGLUE for BERT, we expect that further progress in multi-task, transfer,\\nand unsupervised/self-supervised learning techniques will be necessary to approach human-level per-\\nformance on the benchmark. Overall, we argue that SuperGLUE offers a rich and challenging testbed\\nfor work developing new general-purpose machine learning methods for language understanding.\\n7 Acknowledgments\\nWe thank the original authors of the included datasets in SuperGLUE for their cooperation in the\\ncreation of the benchmark, as well as those who proposed tasks and datasets that we ultimately\\ncould not include.

Conclusion\\nWe introduce PAL, a new method for natural language rea-\\nsoning, using programs as intermediate reasoning steps.\\nDifferently from existing LM-based reasoning approaches,\\nthe main idea is to ofﬂoad solving and calculating to an\\nexternal Python interpreter, instead of using the LLM for\\nboth understanding the problem and solving. This results\\nin a ﬁnal answer that is guaranteed to be accurate, given the\\ncorrectly predicted programmatic steps. We demonstrate\\nthis seamless synergy between an LLM and a Python in-\\nterpreter across 13 tasks from BIG-Bench Hard and other\\nbenchmarks. In all these benchmarks, PAL outperforms\\nlarger LLMs such as PaLM-540 B which use the popular\\n“chain-of-thought” method and sets new state-of-the-art ac-\\ncuracy on all of them.
